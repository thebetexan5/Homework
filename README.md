User Story
Part of being a developer is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience and imagining their experience with the application you’re creating.
A user story, or persona, is a description of an application using natural, non-technical language. Written from the perspective of the application’s end user, they help developers organize their work by allowing them to understand an application’s context and who will be using it.

Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria are the requirements that must be met to complete a user story. They define the boundaries of the user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed.
These criteria can be thought of as instructions for how you should complete a homework assignment. As you plan how to build the application, use them to structure your pages and pseudocode your logic. As you’re working, look back at the list of acceptance criteria to make sure you’ve met all of them. An application is complete only when it meets all of these criteria.
